# The "MediOla" Project

**Disclaimer:** This project is a solo adventure, a journey through Android development during the final year of my computer science degree. It's like a personal coding diary but on GitHub.

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of "MediOla," a project born out of the exploration of Android development during my final year. It's not perfect, but it's a testament to the learning process.

## What is "MediOla"?

In essence, "MediOla" is my attempt at making a healthcare app that's not a total disaster. Think of it as a digital doctor's visit.

## Abstract

Mobile application development has reached new heights, and I thought, why not dive into the Android side of things? "MediOla" is my answer to the need for easy access to healthcare services. It's a dedicated app for virtual treatment, and yes, I coded it alone during the final year of my computer science degree.

## Features

- **Users:** "MediOla" caters to four types of users: Patients, Doctors, MediOla Agents, and Admins.
- **Social Media:** All users share a common social media feature, promoting a healthy lifestyle.
- **MediOla Agents:** Acting as ambulance drivers and delivery agents, they ensure medicines reach your doorstep.
- **Ambulance Service:** Users can call for an ambulance directly through the app.
- **Modules:** Different modules for each user - book appointments, get prescriptions, make friends, and more.
- **Backend:** Built using Android Studio, connected to Google Firebase for seamless backend deployment.

## How to Use (Good Luck)

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (I promise I wasn't entirely clueless during development).
3. Run the app.
4. Marvel at the creation, or laugh at the code - it's your call.
